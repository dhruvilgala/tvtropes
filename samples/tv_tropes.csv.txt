59250	BustedKorea	CompetitionFreak	 Sehun,  big time . He uses up all of Kwangsoo's money because he wanted to be the one to get all stuffed Pororos out of the claw machine, and completely solved a Rubik's cube  in 5 hours  because he was frustrated that he didn't know how to.	t04199	tv877
146010	GameOfThrones	PostRapeTaunt	 In Game of Thrones, Brienne and Jaime come across the bodies of three women who were strung up by Stark bannermen for sleeping with Lannisters. When their killers arrive suddenly, one taunts Brienne by saying "Two died quick. One died slow." This, predictably, mashes Brienne's Berserk Button, and after quickly cutting down the other two men she gives the man a Meaningful Echo of that line while driving a sword into his genitals. 	t17456	tv2143

43438	BoardwalkEmpire	HollywoodHypeMachine	 Gretchen Mol was touted as another "It Girl" when she debuted in Rounders. It didn't pan out, with Rounders doing middling business, and even she (with newfound indie-cred from playing the lead role in The Notorious Bettie Page) admits that it was a particularly bad example building up an unprepared starlet. She is doing quite well with films and a recurring role on critical favorite Boardwalk Empire. 	t10402	tv710
272149	OrphanBlack	WinBackTheCrowd	 Orphan Black also seems to have rebounded from a controversial season with season 4, which has renewed its focus on the show's central mysteries and, unlike previous seasons which frequently seemed to introduce more new questions than they answered, has actually answered many of them (including one that has existed since the very first season of the show, namely why Beth committed suicide). The show seems to have returned to its roots while introducing a number of memorable new characters (particularly M.K., the Hidden Villain Evie Cho, and Ira, who finally gives Ari Millen a chance to portray a character who is radically different from any of the other Castor clones). Thus far, a common opinion seems to be that it's the best season since the first. 	t28118	tv4266
