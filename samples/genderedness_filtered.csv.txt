itself as both godking of the primordium and god to a god    in supernatural the pagan gods are more or less on the level of most of the monsters that the humans fight likely as a result of gods need prayer badly in contrast the angels are largely untouchable with few exceptions and the most effective way of killing an angel thus far in the story has been to persuade another angel in one way or another to do so with zachariah as the sole exception then consider that even in their own belief system they arent the top of the food chain and we have this trope the abrahamic god or as he prefers

manipulate images and create breathtaking effects for film and television audiences however this power has a very controversial dark side famous but longdead celebrities have been digitally resurrected to lend their endorsements to numerous commercial products photographs or scenes from their filmed appearances are digitally processed to show them interacting with various products or people hawking those products these appearances arent limited to film and tv stars historical figures have given their digital support to numerous products and services as well the use of dead celebrities images has diminished over the past decade especially in north america this is in part due to the publics growing distaste for the trend but another influence has been the implementation of inconsistent personality rights laws across the continent that leave advertisers unsure as to whether they need to obtain expensive permission from a dead celebritys estate to use the deceaseds image twelve states and quebec in canada have laws on the books that prohibit the unauthorized use of such images but the length of time these rights exist after death varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and in most states the use of an image in a work of art is excluded  but in most cases nobody has defined whether advertisements are works of art its easier just to hire a double a

CouncilOfAngels	0.0551812444274593	1658	1.0	60.0	the problem with god is that his given definition is one of omnipotence and benevolence this can make it tricky to depict heaven especially if you want to add some grey in there or the notion that the legions of hell are actually a threat so we go down in cosmic denominators though not quite to the lowest the council of angels plot gets around this by stating that heaven is run by angels instead with varying powers running between the physical gods and the powers that be not counting the really young ones often its explained that in the last two millennia god decided to retire someplace sunny or work on some secret project letting humans and angels work things out themselves instead of directly controlling them the angels tend to be somewhat upset about this or maybe there is no personal god at all and the angels follow some more vague ideal of goodness themselves at least supposedly representing its highest embodiment oh even with god around dont expect them to clear up whether judaism christianity or islam is right often theyre not sure themselves if they do know there seems to be an unspoken rule against telling anyone its also not uncommon for different angels to have different viewpoints on the nature of good often associated with human viewpoints they may even be a celestial bureaucracy in brighter settings fluffy cloud heaven is a diversion for newly arrived souls of humans theres often a heaven of heavens where they go eventually where presumably god really is hopefully this is where good beings who are soulkilled go as well nobody ever talks about what this is like ever and its extremely rare for someone to come back from it in darker settings god is evil and doesnt want to deal with the masses personally and the angels either collaborate or are secretly rebelling or maybe god is good but noninterfering but the angels took their free will the totally wrong direction and became knights templar hell might be run in a similar way but its perfectly possible that theres a devil but no god see also god is evil have you seen my god crystal dragon jesus the lowest cosmic denominator and their usual leaders celestial paragons and archangels the opposite number of demon lords and archdevils    in nomine depicts heaven this way nobody in heaven has actually seen god since the middle ages although he is known to be in one of the higher inaccessible levels of heaven and the seraphim council is running things as best they can in the meanwhile  at the same time this is mildly subverted in that yves one of the archangels on the council occasionally acts as a vessel for direct communication by god  and may actually be god in disguise the fact that his illustration bears a striking resemblance to george burns in oh god only adds to the potential confusion  another theory is that eli archangel of creation is god in disguise theres a lot of theories  the third edition of the french version of the game states that he is in vacation in a thermal town somewhere in france    the mst3kfeatured short once upon a honeymoon has an apparently literal example showing a celestial boardroom complete with desk and phones on cloud 7    a form of this is used in the movie wristcutters a love story with the people in charge    angel has the powers that be who are powerful beings from a higher plane who for sure arent the god but are quite powerful    the council of elders from charmed are the lowest cosmic denominator of this    while implied in the original novel see the literature folder this is much more explicitly the case in the good omens 2019 series while metatron is seen once acting as the voice of god though aziraphale compares this to a presidential spokesman being the voice of the president we see that gabriel is the one that aziraphale answers to with michael uriel and sandalphon as his lackeys god taking a handsoff approach to managing the universe at large    the mst3kfeatured short once upon a honeymoon has an apparently literal example showing a celestial boardroom complete with desk and phones on cloud 7    on supernatural only four angels have seen god and of those four one is lucifer and another is on permanent vacation masquerading as the trickster the rest of the angelic host are getting their orders through the other two and have to take it on faith that he even exists in the season 4 finale zachariah one of the higherup angels or at least higher up than castiel uriel and anna all of whom are angelic foot soldiers tells dean that god has left the building as of the season 5 finale the celestial bureaucracy is in anarchy with the loss of michael allowing castiel to go back and bring things to order also chuck was gods literal author avatar in season six this has escalated into a fullon civil war between angels with more than a little spillover onto earth    the bobby dollar series has the whole deal with absent and vague god figure much celestial bureaucracy and a healthy amount of backstabbing    as god rarely intervenes heaven is ruled by seven archangels or if the matter is serious them and their families however some are more equal than others and pretty clear that michael gabriel and raizel hold the most influence   in dora wilk series god rarely intervenes and almost never directly so heaven is ruled by the archangel council which consists of seven archangels and in some situations their families nevertheless its pretty clear that not all archangels are equal as michael gabriel and raizel seem to have more influence than the rest    while implied in the original novel see the literature folder this is much more explicitly the case in the good omens 2019 series while metatron is seen once acting as the voice of god though aziraphale compares this to a presidential spokesman being the voice of the president we see that gabriel is the one that aziraphale answers to with michael uriel and sandalphon as his lackeys god taking a handsoff approach to managing the universe at large    its not explicitly stated in good omens that god isnt exactly running things but beelzebub and the metatron certainly seem to be in charge of the heaven vs hell thing and arent actually 100 sure what theyre supposed to be doing exactly crowley and aziraphale then exploit this like hell unusually for this trope the problem isnt that nobody can find god its that he wont tell anyone anything and he smiles all the time    in guild hunter there is the cadre of ten made up of the ten most powerful archangels in the world the number can dip as low as seven but theres never meant to be more than ten theres only so much of the planet after all    in highschool dx d heaven is ruled by an angelic council led by the archangel michael who after the death of satan formed a peace treaty with the new dark is not evil government of hell while mostly benevolent they are concealing the fact that god is also dead and that the emergence of impossible powers like balance breakers and holy demonic swords is a result of michaels imperfect attempts at taking over his duties    in piers anthonys incarnations of immortality series the angels primarily gabriel are running things because god is off contemplating his perfection in the heaven of heavens unfortunately while they mean well they arent up to the task    no official council but angels seem to be running things without direct contact from god    the uppermost level  apparently hosts discussion with  the final arbiter  having made the decision to give several damned souls a second chance   with the archangel at its head   this trope is used by no less than c s lewis in his climax to the space trilogy that hideous strength the oyeresu angels in control of and personifying each of the other planets have been forbidden to interfere with earth which is under the control of satan as god is working out his own plans for it however the rules also say that theyre supposed to contain satans influence to within the lunar orbit which means that under the right circumstances  like an invasion of venus for example  they can strike back    tears to tiara had the twelve angelsthe white angels then one died and arawn took his place and then quit spectacularly because the rest of the angels are assholes god is probably dead the angels arent sure but theyre no longer looking for him though they claim to carry on his work    uriel turns up every now and then in the dresden files and the other three famous archangels are mentioned god exists but prefers mysteriousways methods other angels have turned up since particularly when harry was dead in ghost story    the valar from the silmarillion are archangels who have been charged with being the guardians of arda the physical world they have many traits in common with both christian angels and mythological gods its believed that j r r tolkien set his cosmology up the way he did so that his devout catholicism and love of mythology wouldnt trip over each other while theyre all good other than melkor none of them are perfect the valar are in turn served by rankandfile angels called the maiar the collective term for both types of angels is ainur however they are not supposed to rule arda but guide the peoples which is a mistake fallen ainur make apparently when the numenoreans attacked valinor after being incited by sauron the valar laid down their governance of the world though they sent maiar in human form to middleearth to help against sauron    the lady comes close

DoubleStandardViolenceChildOnAdult	0.06600109415444158	1209	1.0	50.0	it seems very common for writers to let children hurt adults especially if its played for laughs and the perpetrators get away with it on the other hand any adult who hurts children tends to be seen as evil if said act is done and tends to suffer laserguided karma one reason for that is that a young child not a teenager who is physically an adult is assumed to be fairly easy for most adults to subdue while doing little harm to the child if the child becomes violent and theres few parents out there who would want to wreck their childrens lives by calling the cops if they already have the situation in hand also while kids can be cruel they are also perceived as innocent as well as extremely cute and since adults are considered big and strong and capable the child is very likely to get away with whatever horrible things they do to adults because not only is it entertaining we can also fault the adult for being too incompetent to handle a child note that inversions do happen as demonstrated by hilariously abusive childhood trope the enfant terrible may be an aversion but still expect heroes to show more angst about hurting a child than they would an adult enemy who was doing the same thing related to children are innocent and kids are cruel see would hurt a child for when adults do retaliate and hide your children where children are noticeably absent in video games on similar ethical grounds compare kid hero    illustrated in this xkcd which shows how dark home alone would be if kevin and the bandits

critic okay theres a difference between pranks and attempted murder    the hulk hogan comedy vehicle mr nanny has a few gags that depend on this some of the pranks that the two kids carry out on hogans character include using a supermagnet when hes working out to mess with his 200 pound barbell before letting it fall down from the ceiling he dodges it in time but it could have easily killed him they also rig a device to electrocute him in the bathroom when he steps out of the shower of course its played for laughs because of the use of amusing injuries    the nostalgia critic  he has the

dragged into the ensuing hostilities between harry and the boys  beloved smother    charlie and the chocolate factory zigzags this trope the bratty kids suffering is played for laughs and wonka may have engineered the punishments to scare em straight but said punishments are pretty cartoonish and surreal and all the kids survive in the end though this is not necessarily the case in adaptations further confusing the matter is that wonka warned the kids in advance not to misbehave  but he didnt tell them what would happen if they did misbehave and he didnt try very hard to stop them all in all the man comes across as likable but morally ambiguous and at best creepy good other roald dahl stories play this trope straighter in that childrens violence toward adults almost always falls under pay evil unto evil and is portrayed triumphantly    god doesnt subscribe to this trope in the bible and elisha the prophet went up from thence unto bethel and as he was going up by the way there came forth little children out of the city and mocked him and said unto him go up thou bald head go up thou bald head and he turned back and looked on them and cursed them in the name of the lord and there came forth two she bears out of the wood and tare forty and two children of them yes he had children rent apart by bears on a case of verbal abuse in fact you could extend his aversion of this trope to his interactions with every being in creation  actually these werent children translations that are closer to the original hebrew verify that these were in fact teenagers and young men who essentially told elisha to drop dead in elishas day it was the custom for delinquents like these to bully travelers and mock whatever physical defects said travelers had and considering that a jewish boy became a man at age twelve or thirteen this is the more the case of adultonadult violence the young men got what they deserved    the series thoroughly  deconstructs  this from several angles

EvolutionPowerUp	0.0	1604	0.0	47.0	when something or someone transforms into a more powerfuladvanced stage this is occasionally referred to as evolution while not technically correct evolution is species wide not individual based this has come to be a common way to refer to it this is especially common if the transformation is some form of adaptive ability that allows something to actually modify its biology in response to stimuli expect lamarck was right to show up in such cases in older times this wouldnt be considered wrong as evolution was a synonym for change but thanks to the published theory of a certain charles darwin the term has come to have a much more specific meaning sometimes mixes with multiform balance and super mode in these cases it simply unlocks another form that the character may switch to a temporary evolution its not uncommon for these stages to parallel the bishōnen line with intermediary powerupgrading deformation stages prior to an beautiful
