675680	Worldwar	FreudianTrio	 the three most senior members of the alien Race's conquest fleet exemplify the parts of the human psyche, in the context of a generally very conservative and cautious species-society   Id  Straha, third in the hierarchy, is so aggressive, radical, adaptable and short-term oriented his superior compares him to humans (not a compliment).   After the conquest suffers setbacks, he tries to overthrow his commander and take over the fleet. When that fails, he takes refuge with humanity, only to later regret his choice.  Ego  Atvar, the fleetlord, tries to balance tradition and change, caution and initiative, and play off the other two against each other.  Superego  Kirel, the second-in-command, is focused on not making any mistakes, and never deviating from the path laid down, almost regardless of price or consequence. His attitude is very common among the junior members of the fleet, but he represents it at the very top.	t08567	lit15330

55743	Berserker	HumanityIsSuperior	 In Fred Saberhagen's Berserker novels, the technically pacifistic Carmpan race (they are literally pained by even indirect performance of a violent act against any species, but have no trouble giving humans militarily useful intel) found in humanity the potential "badassness" to be effective Berserker-killers, and so trained and equipped us to be just that. They were certainly deeply indebted to humanity for suffering the scourge of war through its history until the point where nothing less would serve. But where did the Carmpans train and equip Humanity? What follows suggests that the humans had all the goods:  When they came, you were dug in and ready on a hundred worlds. Because you were, some of you and some of us are now alive. 	t10685	lit1187
