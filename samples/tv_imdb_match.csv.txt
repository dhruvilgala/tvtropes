395560	TheDreamstone	ComicallyLopsidedRivalry	 Basing itself heavily on Golden Age era cartoon rivalries, the Urpneys were constantly at the brunt of heavy slapstick against the more powerful and heavily safeguarded heroes. Odd episodes ended on a less downbeat note for the Urpneys, or the Noops suffering some minor unpleasantness, but even then the Urpneys were the clear losers of the feud.	thedreamstone	tt0299286	t04126	tv6098

346693	StarTrekTheNextGeneration	ProudWarriorRaceGuys	 The first two books of the Star Trek: Klingon Empire series show what happens when the Klingons meet another Proud Warrior Race, the Children of San-Tarah. The two get on swimmingly, with many bloody battles between them. Interestingly enough, the Klingons' more notable rivals, the Romulans, show themselves to be this in the Star Trek Novel Verse. It's a bit of an Alternate Character Interpretation; while the TV series (Star Trek: The Next Generation onward, at least) focused on their sneaky, politically manipulative Chessmaster tendencies, the novels portray the hot-blooded warrior aspect of Romulan culture far more prominently. They certainly don't lose their Chessmaster traits, though.  Another novel has the Enterprise visit an empire that arose from a group of Chinese colonists on a remote planet. Riker teaches the local nobles how to play poker but finds it far too easy to beat them. Then he realizes why: they never fold. When he asks them about it, they tell him that a true warrior never backs down from a fight. He then explains it in a way that makes sense to them: a good general will cut his losses and pull back his troops in order to win a battle or a war. Once they start seeing the game in this way, they get much better at it. Another local starts a rivalry with Worf and demands a duel to the death. They postpone it until the end of the book, but then they (quite sensibly) decide to settle this matter with a game of poker. 	startrekthenextgeneration	tt0092455	t30554	tv5461
