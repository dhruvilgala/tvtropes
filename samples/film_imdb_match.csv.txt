560066	TheDarkKnightRises	SequelDisplacement	 Downplayed with The Dark Knight Trilogy. While Batman Begins is considered a pretty good Batman film, especially compared to the Schumacher horrors that preceded it, it's The Dark Knight that is considered the greatest film of this generation, and thus is more remembered and acclaimed. Home media even refers to the series as "The Dark Knight Trilogy", rather than the "Batman Begins Trilogy". This caused some confusion with The Dark Knight Rises's plot, as it pulls more from the events of Batman Begins than of The Dark Knight. Nevertheless, few people are unaware that The Dark Knight is not the first installment in the series, and the film remains a classic to this day. 	thedarkknightrises	tt1345836	t19847	f12644
221031	GoneGirl	TechnologyMarchesOn	 Shooting films on, uh, film, pretty much died off. By the early 2010s digital video cameras had improved to the point that the average viewer couldn't tell the difference between the two formats. Shooting to digital video is far cheaper than buying film stock, as well as eliminating the need to develop and scan the film.  Distribution has moved entirely digital as well, as hard drives cost far less than printing thousands of reels of film. Theaters had to upgrade to digital projectors or close due to movies no longer being distributed on film reels.  Compared to editing actual film on a flatbed, editing digital video files in an editing program is far faster, and most modern programs can run on off-the-shelf PCs. For example, Gone Girl was edited on off-the-shelf Macs using Adobe Premiere. 	gonegirl	tt2267998	t22391	f4995
545152	TheBookOfEli	MilesToGoBeforeISleep	 In The Book of Eli, Eli is on a Mission from God to deliver a Bible to people who will make good with it. He's spent the better part of three decades crossing the post-apocalyptic United States of America while blind and at the climax he gets shot in the gut by the Big Bad and is very visibly dying by inches, but he toughs it out long enough to reach the outpost in Alcatraz Island where information is pooled to rebuild society and narrate the entire King James Bible (which he spent all of those years memorizin) to be written down. In his final voice-over, he's thankful to God for finally being able to rest. 	thebookofeli	tt1037705	t14122	f12286
103778	CasinoRoyale2006	WackyWaysideTribe	 A variation occurs in the James Bond Action Prologue, which is usually a cool action scene at the start. The ones from Goldfinger, Thunderball and Octopussy have no connection to the story whatsoever (unless you count the scar in Thunderball). Some only serve for a introduction (Red Grant and SPECTRE training in From Russia with Love, Scaramanga and his "funhouse" in The Man with the Golden Gun, Henry Gupta - briefly - in Tomorrow Never Dies, Bond getting his license to kill in Casino Royale (2006)). The rest give Back Story, though sometimes you only discover after the credits. 	casinoroyale2006	tt0381061	t25452	f2238
