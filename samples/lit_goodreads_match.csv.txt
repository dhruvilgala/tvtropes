105688	TalesOfTheFiveHundredKingdoms	LiteralGenie	 In the Mercedes Lackey book One Good Knight, a dragon is summoned to ravage the land until presented with routine virgin sacrifices. The dragon is a noble/knightly sort, and while he cannot fight the spell he is able to limit the ravaging to destruction of property and decimation of livestock... and finds the spell does not require him to devour or even harm the maidens he carries off. Imagine the surprise of the Dragon Slayer and the princess more or less rescued by same when they track it down and find the "victims" arrayed in defence of the "monster". 	talesofthefivehundredkingdoms	Mercedes Lackey	female	lit9895	t12970

When his first term was up, they noticed he hadn't raised taxes, taken bribes or embezzled public funds, so they voted him in again. That was over a century ago, and he's still mayor as of the most recent Discworld Companion. 	discworld	Terry Pratchett	male	lit2804	t16862
